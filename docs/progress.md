## Technical Decisions Log

### Oct 22, 2025
**Decision:** Use Vanilla JS + GSAP instead of React
**Rationale:**
- No framework overhead
- Direct DOM control for animations
- Simpler integration with file system
- Faster performance for animation-heavy UI
- Aligns with "build a view layer" philosophy

**Decision:** Read/write directly to Obsidian vault
**Rationale:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Backend can run independently
- No API to maintain
- Vault is single source of truth
- User owns their data

**Decision:** Markdown for all content
**Rationale:**
- Human-readable
- Version controllable
- Portable
- Works seamlessly with Obsidian
- Easy to parse and render

## Blockers & Questions

### Current Blockers
- None (initial setup phase)

### Open Questions
1. **File System API:** Browser support and fallback strategy?
2. **Folder Cover Graphics:** Will these be SVG, images, or CSS-generated?
3. **Markdown Library:** Which one to use? (marked.js, markdown-it, etc.)
4. **Vault Path:** How to let user configure vault location in browser?

## Notes & Learnings

### Session 1 (Oct 22, 2025)
- Established clear product vision: Trapper Keeper UI as view layer
- Defined two-view structure (Browse, Working)
- Clarified content flow in Working View
- Confirmed tech stack (Vanilla JS + GSAP)
- Created comprehensive documentation for resumption
- User emphasized: "Think holding a tablet" for interaction design
- Key insight: Not replacing Obsidian, building on top of it

### Design Insights
- Physical metaphor is critical (folder opening, page tearing)
- Deliberate user actions drive state changes (not automatic)
- One folder open at a time (visual focus)
- Day reset should be manual trigger with automatic fallback
- Incomplete tasks flash â†’ fade (clean "today's tasks" logic)

1. âœ… Read `README.md` for project summary
2. âœ… Review `docs/architecture.md` for technical decisions
3. âœ… Check this file (`docs/progress.md`) for current status
4. âœ… Review `docs/design-decisions.md` for UX/UI rationale
5. â¬œ Check git branch: `claude/day-timer-initial-spec-011CUNhupTutuEhLTQ2xQwzm`
6. â¬œ Review most recent commits for context
7. â¬œ Check for any new user requirements or changes
